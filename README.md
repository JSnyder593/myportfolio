# Using React
This project was created with the React app! 

To create your own enter the command below into your CLI. The part that says 'my-app' can be whatever you'd like to call the app/folder. 
```
npx create-react-app my-app
```

## Installation

To install dependencies/etc. enter the commands below. 

```
npm init -y
```

```
npm install
``` 

Afterwards you can start your app and making changes to it after entering another command: 

```
npm start
```

This will initialize the app onto your localhost at localhost:3000 where you can see things changes and receive errors in real time.


## Deployment

When you are satisfied with the app you have created, build it by running: 

```
npm build
```

The bundles everything into a folder and optimizes the build for performance when you deploy the app.

See [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information about deploying your app.

### Ejecting your Build`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
